# API Contracts

This directory is intentionally empty.

**Rationale**: The AICA/PICA Mastery Sprint is a Jupyter notebook-based educational tool with no external APIs, web services, or client-server architecture. All functionality is self-contained within the notebook using Python functions and ipywidgets.

If future features require API integration (e.g., cloud-based progress sync, LMS integration), API contracts will be documented here using OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
