The labyrinthine artery typically originates from the premeatal (77%) or meatal (21%) segments and supplies the inner ear.

    "        \"explanation\": \"This is classic lateral pontine syndrome from AICA occlusion. Features include: CN VII palsy (facial paralysis), CN VIII dysfunction (hearing loss, vertigo), and spinal trigeminal tract involvement (facial sensory loss). Cerebellar ataxia and Horner syndrome may also be present. Corticospinal tract and medial lemniscus are spared (supplied by midline perforators).\"\n",

    "        \"correct\": \"C) Gently mobilize the loop medially and drill lateral IAC\",\n",
    "        \"explanation\": \"AICA loops extending into the IAC (occurs in 50% of cases) must be preserved to maintain labyrinthine artery flow and hearing. Gentle arachnoid dissection allows medial mobilization. Take less IAC bone if needed. Coagulation or division causes hearing loss. Approach conversion for this alone is not necessary.\"\n",

    "        \"correct\": \"B) They are end-arteries supplying the brainstem\",\n",
    "        \"explanation\": \"AICA perforating arteries are end-arteries with no collateral circulation.

    "        \"explanation\": \"The rostral trunk of AICA courses above the flocculus to the superior petrosal surface and anastomoses with SCA at the cortical level. The caudal trunk courses below the flocculus and anastomoses with PICA. These anastomoses provide collateral circulation for cortical territories but not for perforators.\"\n",

    "        \"correct\": \"B) More vessels are at risk and must be preserved\",\n",
    "        \"explanation\": \"Duplicate AICA (26% of cases) means two vessels in the CPA that must both be identified and preserved. Both can give perforators and nerve-related branches.
