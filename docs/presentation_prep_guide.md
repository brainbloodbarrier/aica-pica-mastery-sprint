## 📋 Slide-by-Slide Preparation

### PART 1: INTRODUCTION & CONTEXT (5 minutes)

---

#### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
**Title**: *AICA & PICA: Microsurgical Anatomy of the Posterior Fossa Cerebellar Arteries*

**Opening Line**: "Good morning/afternoon. Over the next hour, we'll explore the microsurgical anatomy of the anteroinferior and posteroinferior cerebellar arteries - two vessels that are encountered in virtually every posterior fossa surgery."

**Memory Anchor**: 🎯 *"Two arteries, every surgery"*

**Transition to Slide 2**: "Let's start by placing these arteries in anatomical context..."

---

#### **Slide 2: Posterior Circulation Overview**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Three paired cerebellar arteries supply the cerebellum: SCA, AICA, and PICA"*

**What to Say**:
"The posterior circulation includes three pairs of cerebellar arteries. The SCA arises from the basilar apex, AICA from the mid-basilar, and PICA from the vertebral artery. Each has distinct but overlapping territories. Understanding their relationships is fundamental to posterior fossa surgery."

**Memory Anchor**: 🧠 *"Top to bottom: SCA-AICA-PICA, Basilar-Basilar-Vertebral"*

**Key Points to Emphasize**:
- SCA = superior surface
- AICA = anteroinferior surface + CPA + inner ear
- PICA = posteroinferior surface + fourth ventricle + lateral medulla

**Transition to Slide 3**: "Why does this anatomy matter surgically?"

---

#### **Slide 3: Surgical Relevance**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"AICA and PICA are encountered in most posterior fossa surgeries"*

**What to Say**:
"AICA and PICA are critical in CPA tumor surgery, fourth ventricle lesions, foramen magnum pathology, and vertebrobasilar aneurysms. The high anatomical variability means we can't rely on textbook descriptions alone - preoperative angiography is essential for individualizing our surgical approach."

**Memory Anchor**: 🔪 *"CPA, fourth ventricle, foramen magnum, aneurysms"*

**Surgical Cases to Mention** (if comfortable):
- Acoustic neuroma retrosigmoid approach
- Fourth ventricle ependymoma via telovelar
- Vertebral-PICA aneurysm
- Foramen magnum meningioma

**Transition to Slide 4**: "Let's dive deep into AICA first..."

---

### PART 2: AICA DEEP-DIVE (20-25 minutes)

---

#### **Slide 4: AICA Overview**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"AICA is the central cerebellar artery of the pontine angle"*

**What to Say**:
"AICA courses through the cerebellopontine angle with an intimate relationship to the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves. It supplies the petrosal cerebellar surface, the middle cerebellar peduncle, and the inner ear. It's the central landmark in CPA surgery."

**Memory Anchor**: 🎧 *"CPA artery, CN 7/8 buddy, inner ear blood"*

**Confidence Builder**: "Think of AICA as the 'CPA artery' - if you understand AICA, you understand CPA anatomy."

**Transition to Slide 5**: "Let's start with origin patterns..."

---

#### **Slide 5: AICA Origin Patterns**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"72% single trunk, 26% duplicate, 2% triplicate from basilar artery"*

**What to Say**:
"Three-quarters arise as a single trunk from the lower half of the basilar artery. About a quarter are duplicate - meaning two separate AICAs on one side - and triplicate origins occur in about 2% of cases. These duplicates represent persistent transverse pontine arteries from embryological development. Interestingly, rostral duplicate AICAs give nerve-related branches more often than caudal ones."

**Memory Anchor**: 📊 *"3/4 single, 1/4 double, rare triple"*

**Quantitative Precision**: "72-26-2. These are Rhoton's numbers from extensive cadaveric dissections."

**Anticipated Question**: *"Does duplication matter surgically?"*
- **Answer**: "Yes - duplicates mean more vessels at risk in the CPA. You need to identify and preserve both trunks. The rostral trunk is particularly important as it's more likely to give the labyrinthine artery."

**Transition to Slide 6**: "Now, how do we think about AICA's course?"

---

#### **Slide 6: AICA Four-Segment Classification**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Four segments: anterior pontine, lateral pontine, flocculopeduncular, cortical"*

**What to Say**:
"Rhoton divides AICA into four segments. Anterior pontine from origin to the abducens nerve. Lateral pontine from CN 6 to the facial-vestibulocochlear complex. Flocculopeduncular from the nerves to cortical branching. And finally cortical terminal branches. This classification helps us communicate about specific portions during surgery."

**Memory Anchor**: 🗺️ *"Origin→6→7/8→fissure→cortex"*

**Hand Gesture**: Use your hand to trace the course from midline basilar → lateral → posterior toward flocculus

**Transition to Slide 7**: "The nerve-related segments are the most surgically critical..."

---

#### **Slide 7: Nerve-Related AICA Anatomy**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"AICA intimately related to facial and vestibulocochlear nerve complex"*

**What to Say**:
"The lateral pontine segment has an intimate relationship with CN 7 and 8. AICA can pass anterior to, posterior to, between, or even through the nerve complex. For surgical purposes, we divide this into premeatal, meatal, and postmeatal segments based on relationship to the internal auditory canal. This classification matters tremendously in acoustic neuroma surgery."

**Memory Anchor**: 🎯 *"Pre-meatal-post, like pre-op-op-post-op"*

**Pause Here**: "The next three slides will detail these nerve-related segments."

**Transition to Slide 8**: "First, the premeatal segment..."

---

#### **Slide 8: AICA Premeatal Segment**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Premeatal segment courses from basilar artery to facial-vestibulocochlear nerves"*

**What to Say**:
"The premeatal segment is the first part you encounter in a retrosigmoid approach. 88% are solitary, 12% are double. In the vast majority - 82% - it courses anteroinferior to the nerves. This is the segment that gives rise to the labyrinthine artery in 77% of cases."

**Memory Anchor**: 🔢 *"88 solitary, 82 anteroinferior, 77 give labyrinthine"*

**Surgical Pearl**: "In retrosigmoid CPA exposure, the premeatal segment is your first landmark after opening the dura. Identify it early to avoid traction injury."

**Transition to Slide 9**: "Next comes the meatal segment, which forms loops..."

---

#### **Slide 9: AICA Meatal Segment & Loops**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Meatal loop reaches porus or enters canal in 50% of cases"*

**What to Say**:
"The meatal segment is adjacent to the internal auditory canal and forms a laterally convex loop - called the medial loop - in many cases. The critical number here is 50%: in half of all CPAs, this meatal loop reaches the porus or actually enters the internal auditory canal. 82% have one meatal segment, 18% have two. The majority course below or between CN 7 and 8."

**Memory Anchor**: 🔄 *"50% reach or enter the canal - HALF"*

**Surgical Risk**: "This loop is at risk during IAC drilling for acoustic neuroma. You must identify it before removing bone, or you risk hearing loss from labyrinthine artery injury."

**Additional Detail** (if time): "Some AICAs form a second loop toward the subarcuate fossa - this creates an 'M' configuration. This subarcuate loop is present in 72% of CPAs."

**Transition to Slide 10**: "After the meatal segment, AICA bifurcates..."

---

#### **Slide 10: AICA Bifurcation Patterns**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"AICA bifurcates into rostral and caudal trunks near nerve complex"*

**What to Say**:
"Most AICAs bifurcate into rostral and caudal trunks. About two-thirds bifurcate before crossing the nerves, one-third after. The rostral trunk courses above the flocculus to supply the superior petrosal surface and anastomoses with SCA. The caudal trunk goes below the flocculus to the inferior petrosal surface and often enters the cerebellomedullary fissure near the foramen of Luschka, where it anastomoses with PICA."

**Memory Anchor**: 🍴 *"Fork in the road: rostral up → SCA, caudal down → PICA"*

**Surgical Note**: "These anastomoses provide collateral flow if you need to sacrifice a cortical branch, but perforators have no collaterals."

**Transition to Slide 11**: "Now let's discuss the most clinically important AICA branch..."

---

#### **Slide 11: Labyrinthine (Internal Auditory) Artery**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Labyrinthine artery supplies inner ear and is most consistent AICA branch"*

**What to Say**:
"The labyrinthine artery is the most consistent AICA branch. 30% of patients have one, 54% have two, 14% have three, and 2% have four labyrinthine arteries. 77% originate from the premeatal segment. This artery enters the internal auditory canal with the nerves and supplies the cochlea and vestibular apparatus. Occlusion causes sudden profound hearing loss."

**Memory Anchor**: 🎧 *"77% from premeatal, most have 2, hearing depends on it"*

**Surgical Imperative**: "This is why we work in the arachnoid plane. The labyrinthine artery and its origin must be preserved if you want the patient to hear postoperatively."

**Anticipated Question**: *"What if you injure it?"*
- **Answer**: "Immediate profound ipsilateral hearing loss. There's no collateral circulation to the inner ear. Once it's gone, hearing is gone."

**Transition to Slide 12**: "AICA also gives critical perforating branches..."

---

#### **Slide 12: Recurrent Perforating Arteries**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Recurrent perforators supply brainstem from AICA nerve-related vessels"*

**What to Say**:
"82% of CPAs have recurrent perforating arteries - small branches that loop toward the meatus and then recur medially to supply the middle cerebellar peduncle, the trigeminal entry zone of the pons, and the superolateral medulla. These are end-arteries. 25% of labyrinthine arteries actually arise from these recurrent perforators."

**Memory Anchor**: ⚠️ *"82% present, cannot be sacrificed, end-arteries"*

**Surgical Danger**: "Tearing a perforating artery causes brainstem infarction. You cannot sacrifice these. Work around them, not through them."

**Transition to Slide 13**: "One more AICA branch - the subarcuate artery..."

---

#### **Slide 13: Subarcuate & Cerebellosubarcuate Arteries**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Subarcuate artery penetrates dura at subarcuate fossa to supply petrous bone"*

**What to Say**:
"72% of CPAs have a subarcuate artery that penetrates the dura at the subarcuate fossa to supply the petrous bone around the semicircular canals. Interestingly, this creates a potential route for mastoid infection to cause meningitis or superior petrosal sinus thrombosis. Most originate from the postmeatal segment and course posterosuperior to the nerves."

**Memory Anchor**: 🦴 *"72%, petrous bone supply, mastoid infection route"*

**Clinical Pearl**: "This is more of anatomical interest than daily surgical relevance, but it explains why petrosal infections can have intracranial complications."

**Transition to Slide 14**: "Now let's shift to PICA, which Rhoton called the most complex cerebellar artery..."

---

### PART 3: PICA DEEP-DIVE (20-25 minutes)

---

#### **Slide 14: PICA Overview**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"PICA is the most complex and variable cerebellar artery"*

**What to Say**:
"PICA has the most complex, tortuous, and variable course of all cerebellar arteries. It's the largest branch of the vertebral artery and supplies the cerebellomedullary fissure, the inferior fourth ventricular roof, and the suboccipital cerebellar surface. You encounter it in foramen magnum surgery, fourth ventricle approaches, and posterior fossa decompression. Unlike AICA's relatively predictable course, PICA demands careful individualized assessment."

**Memory Anchor**: 🌀 *"Most complex, most variable, mandatory imaging"*

**Tone Shift**: "PICA is where textbooks fail you. The variability is so high that angiography isn't optional - it's essential."

**Transition to Slide 15**: "Rhoton divides PICA into five segments..."

---

#### **Slide 15: PICA Five-Segment Classification**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Five segments based on anatomical landmarks and course"*

**What to Say**:
"Five segments: anterior medullary from origin to the olive prominence, lateral medullary from the olive to the glossopharyngeal-vagus-accessory rootlets, tonsillomedullary from those rootlets to mid-tonsil, telovelotonsillar from mid-tonsil through the fissure to the suboccipital surface, and finally cortical terminal branches. The tonsillomedullary and telovelotonsillar segments form the caudal and cranial loops around the tonsil."

**Memory Anchor**: 🗺️ *"A-L-T-T-C: Anterior-Lateral-Tonsillo-Telovelotonsillar-Cortical"*

**Visual Strategy**: Trace the course with your finger while speaking: origin → lateral → down around tonsil → up through fissure → cortex

**Transition to Slide 16**: "Let's start with PICA's highly variable origin..."

---

#### **Slide 16: PICA Origin from Vertebral Artery**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Origin varies from 14mm below to 26mm above foramen magnum"*

**What to Say**:
"PICA's origin is remarkably variable - from 14 millimeters below the foramen magnum to 26 millimeters above it, with an average of 8.6 millimeters above. The average distance from the vertebrobasilar junction is about 17 millimeters. 84% of hemispheres have a PICA - 16% are absent or hypoplastic. The diameter at origin ranges from 0.5 to 3.4 millimeters, averaging 2 millimeters."

**Memory Anchor**: 📏 *"14 below to 26 above foramen magnum, average 8.6 above, 16% absent"*

**Surgical Impact**: "This variability is why you need preoperative imaging for far-lateral and foramen magnum approaches. You need to know where PICA is before you open."

**Anticipated Question**: *"What supplies the territory if PICA is absent?"*
- **Answer**: "Usually a dominant AICA captures the inferior cerebellar territory. Occasionally the contralateral PICA crosses the midline as an azygous PICA."

**Transition to Slide 17**: "After origin, PICA courses through the anterior medullary segment..."

---

#### **Slide 17: Anterior Medullary Segment**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Anterior medullary segment courses from origin to olive prominence"*

**What to Say**:
"This segment courses anterior to the olive and the hypoglossal rootlets. It gives about one perforator per hemisphere on average. If PICA has a low origin and ascends directly posterior to the medulla, this segment may be absent entirely."

**Memory Anchor**: 🫒 *"Origin to olive, ~1 perforator"*

**Brief Point**: "This segment is relatively straightforward compared to what comes next."

**Transition to Slide 18**: "The lateral medullary segment is where PICA's critical perforators arise..."

---

#### **Slide 18: Lateral Medullary Segment**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Lateral medullary segment supplies lateral medulla via perforating branches"*

**What to Say**:
"From the olive to the glossopharyngeal-vagus-accessory rootlets. The lateral medulla is PICA's primary territory - embryologically, PICA starts as a cervical vessel that ascends to supply the developing medulla. This segment gives an average of 1.8 perforators per hemisphere. These supply the lateral and posterior medulla. PICA occlusion causes lateral medullary syndrome - Wallenberg syndrome."

**Memory Anchor**: 💀 *"PICA's home territory, ~2 perforators, Wallenberg syndrome"*

**Clinical Moment**: "Wallenberg syndrome: vertigo, ataxia, Horner's, crossed sensory loss, dysphagia. The classic lateral medullary stroke."

**Transition to Slide 19**: "Now PICA curves around the tonsil, forming the caudal loop..."

---

#### **Slide 19: Tonsillomedullary Segment & Caudal Loop**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Caudal loop may dip below foramen magnum near tonsil lower pole"*

**What to Say**:
"The tonsillomedullary segment courses posterior to CN 9, 10, and 11, then medially across the posterior medulla near the caudal pole of the tonsil. Here it forms the caudal - or infratonsillar - loop. This loop averages 6.9 millimeters above the foramen magnum but can range from 7 millimeters below to 18 millimeters above. In 55% it's superior to the tonsil tip, in 19% inferior, in 26% at the same level. This segment is the most productive for perforators - averaging 3.3 per hemisphere."

**Memory Anchor**: 🔽 *"Caudal loop, 7mm below to 18mm above foramen, most perforators (3.3)"*

**Surgical Relevance**: "In far-lateral approaches, you need to know if the loop dips below the foramen magnum. If it does, you'll encounter it during C1 arch removal."

**Transition to Slide 20**: "Then PICA ascends to form the cranial loop..."

---

#### **Slide 20: Telovelotonsillar Segment & Cranial Loop**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Cranial loop wraps around tonsil between tela choroidea and tonsil"*

**What to Say**:
"This is PICA's most complex segment. From mid-tonsil medial surface, PICA ascends through the telovelotonsillar fissure to exit onto the suboccipital surface. It forms the cranial - or supratonsillar - loop between the tonsil below and the tela choroidea and inferior medullary velum above. The apex usually sits over the central velum, inferior to the fastigium. This segment gives choroidal branches to the fourth ventricle choroid plexus. This anatomy is critical for the telovelar approach to the fourth ventricle."

**Memory Anchor**: 🔼 *"Cranial loop, tonsil below / velum above, telovelar approach key"*

**Surgical Technique**: "In the telovelar approach, you split the tonsils, identify the cranial loop, and work in the tela between PICA and the inferior medullary velum. PICA defines your lateral boundary."

**Transition to Slide 21**: "Where does PICA bifurcate?"

---

#### **Slide 21: PICA Bifurcation Patterns**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"PICA bifurcates into medial vermian and lateral hemispheric trunks"*

**What to Say**:
"Most PICAs bifurcate into a smaller medial trunk for the vermis and adjacent hemisphere, and a larger lateral trunk for most of the hemispheric and tonsillar suboccipital surface. Bifurcation usually occurs posterior to the brainstem as PICA courses around the tonsil. The most common site is in the telovelotonsillar fissure around the rostral pole of the tonsil. Rhoton describes four bifurcation patterns based on location relative to the tonsil: inferolateral, inferomedial, superomedial, and superolateral."

**Memory Anchor**: 🍴 *"Medial small vermis, lateral large hemisphere, bifurcates around tonsil"*

**Surgical Note**: "Early bifurcation means more vessels at risk in the telovelotonsillar approach. Know your patient's anatomy."

**Transition to Slide 22**: "PICA can have rare extradural origins..."

---

#### **Slide 22: PICA Extradural Origin**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Rare extradural PICA origin occurs below foramen magnum at C1/C2 level"*

**What to Say**:
"In rare cases, PICA arises from the extradural vertebral artery behind the atlantooccipital joint and penetrates the dura at the dorsolateral medulla. There's no anterior medullary segment or full lateral medullary segment. This reflects dominance of the C1 radiculopial artery via the lateral medullary artery. It can loop downward behind the accessory nerve and C1-C2 roots. The posterior spinal artery may arise from the extradural PICA."

**Memory Anchor**: 🦴 *"C1/C2 origin, no anterior/lateral medullary segments, know it preop"*

**Surgical Critical**: "You must recognize this on preoperative imaging for far-lateral or foramen magnum approaches. If you don't know it's there, you can injure it during C1 arch removal or dural opening."

**Transition to Slide 23**: "Let's talk about PICA variations..."

---

#### **Slide 23: PICA Anatomical Variations**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"PICA absent in 16%, hypoplastic in 5-16%, duplicate or azygous rare"*

**What to Say**:
"16% absent - territory supplied by dominant AICA or contralateral PICA. 5 to 16% hypoplastic with small caliber and limited territory. Duplicate PICA means two trunks from the vertebral artery. Azygous or bihemispheric PICA is a rare midline vessel supplying both cerebellar hemispheres. Fenestration means dual origin reconstituting to a single trunk. The key concept is PICA-AICA balance: when PICA is small, AICA is usually large and captures the inferior cerebellar territory."

**Memory Anchor**: 🔄 *"16% absent, dominant AICA compensates, PICA-AICA balance"*

**Clinical Pearl**: "Always check the contralateral side and AICA territory on angiography to understand the vascular balance."

**Transition to Slide 24**: "Now let's integrate AICA and PICA..."

---

### PART 4: INTEGRATION & SYNTHESIS (5-10 minutes)

---

#### **Slide 24: AICA-PICA Anastomoses & Vascular Territories**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Distal AICA and PICA anastomose providing collateral cerebellar circulation"*

**What to Say**:
"AICA's caudal trunk anastomoses with PICA at the cortical level, and AICA's rostral trunk anastomoses with SCA. These anastomoses provide collateral flow if you need to sacrifice a cortical branch or if there's proximal occlusion. However - and this is critical - perforating arteries are end-arteries with no collaterals. Territory boundaries between AICA and PICA are highly variable. The balance concept means dominant AICA correlates with smaller PICA and vice versa."

**Memory Anchor**: 🔗 *"Cortical collaterals YES, perforator collaterals NO"*

**Surgical Decision-Making**: "You can sacrifice cortical branches if necessary for exposure. You absolutely cannot sacrifice perforators without causing infarction."

**Transition to Slide 25**: "Let's summarize with key surgical pearls..."

---

#### **Slide 25: Summary & Surgical Pearls**
**Key Sentence on Slide**: *"Anatomical mastery of AICA and PICA is essential for posterior fossa surgery"*

**What to Say**:
"Let me summarize the key points. AICA: the central CPA landmark with nerve-related premeatal, meatal, and postmeatal segments. Preserve the labyrinthine artery for hearing. Expect high variability in loops and duplication. PICA: the most complex and variable cerebellar artery forming caudal and cranial loops around the tonsil. It's the primary supply to the lateral medulla. Remember 16% are absent with territory compensation. The surgical principles that unite both: mandatory preoperative imaging, early identification, arachnoid plane dissection to protect perforators, awareness of variations, and microsurgical gentle technique."

**Memory Anchor**: 🎯 *"AICA = CPA + CN7/8, PICA = complex + variable, Perforators = sacred"*

**Closing Strong**: "Thank you. I'm happy to take questions."

**Anticipated Questions** (see Q&A section below)

---

## 🗣️ Anticipated Q&A

### Technical Anatomy Questions

**Q: "What's the most common cause of hearing loss in acoustic neuroma surgery?"**
- **A**: "Labyrinthine artery injury or stretch injury to the cochlear nerve. The labyrinthine artery has no collateral circulation - if you compromise it, hearing is lost. This is why we work in the arachnoid plane and identify it early."

**Q: "How do you decide between telovelar vs transvermian for fourth ventricle access?"**
- **A**: "Lesion location is primary. Telovelar gives you excellent access to the inferior fourth ventricle and lateral recesses without cutting cerebellum. Transvermian is better for superior fourth ventricle lesions. PICA anatomy matters - if the cranial loop is very high or the bifurcation is early, telovelar becomes technically more challenging. Preoperative MRA/CTA helps plan the approach."

**Q: "You said 16% don't have PICA - does that change your surgical approach?"**
- **A**: "Absolutely. If PICA is absent, you need to know what's compensating - usually a dominant AICA. This affects your exposure for fourth ventricle or foramen magnum surgery. The vascular anatomy dictates dissection planes. You can't use textbook landmarks when the anatomy is variant."

### Clinical Scenario Questions

**Q: "Young patient with sudden hearing loss, vertigo, facial weakness. What artery and where?"**
- **A**: "AICA territory stroke. Likely proximal AICA involving the labyrinthine artery origin (hearing loss), lateral pons (facial weakness), and vestibular nuclei (vertigo). This is lateral pontine syndrome. Imaging should show AICA occlusion, likely embolic."

**Q: "What's your approach to a vertebral-PICA aneurysm?"**
- **A**: "Depends on aneurysm location and PICA anatomy. Far-lateral approach gives you control of the VA proximal and distal to PICA origin. Key decision: can you clip and preserve PICA, or do you need to sacrifice it? If sacrifice is necessary, check if the contralateral PICA is dominant and if AICA can compensate. Balloon test occlusion may be useful."

**Q: "Patient has PICA infarct. Why are they dysphagic and hoarse but not weak?"**
- **A**: "Lateral medullary syndrome - Wallenberg. PICA supplies the lateral medulla including the nucleus ambiguus (CN 9/10 motor nuclei) causing dysphagia and vocal cord paralysis. But it spares the medial medulla where the pyramidal tract runs, so there's no hemiparesis. Classic teaching: lateral stroke = crossed sensory, ipsilateral Horner's, dysphagia, ataxia. Medial stroke = contralateral hemiparesis, tongue deviation."

### Surgical Technique Questions

**Q: "How do you avoid perforator injury?"**
- **A**: "Three principles: One, stay in the arachnoid plane - don't dissect into pia. Two, identify perforators early and preserve their arachnoid envelope. Three, never use bipolar on stretched vessels - relax the brain first with CSF drainage or gentle retraction release. If you tear a perforator, that's a brainstem stroke."

**Q: "Meatal loop is in your way during IAC drilling - what do you do?"**
- **A**: "Two options: gently mobilize it away from the canal by dissecting arachnoid, or drill around it and take less IAC bone. Forcing it or coagulating it risks hearing loss. Sometimes less bone exposure is better than vascular injury."

**Q: "Do you routinely do intraoperative angiography for posterior fossa cases?"**
- **A**: "Not routinely, but for aneurysms yes. For CPA tumors, no - but I study the preoperative MRA/CTA carefully and know where AICA and its branches are before I start. If I'm working near a major vessel, I'll use micro-Doppler to confirm flow before and after dissection."

## 📝 Final Prep Notes

### Your Unique Voice

**Personalize this presentation**:
- Add: "In my experience..." when discussing surgical pearls
- Include: Your own surgical photos/videos if you have them
- Mention: Cases you've done that illustrate key points
- Acknowledge: Mentors or teachers who taught you this anatomy

### Confidence Builders

**Before presenting, remember**:
- You know this material deeply (you spent 1-2 days mastering it)
- This audience wants to learn from you
- Complex anatomy is challenging for everyone - your explanations help
- Questions are opportunities to teach, not tests
- Your goal: Help surgeons operate more safely

### If You Get Stuck

**Recovery strategies**:
- Pause, take a sip of water, collect your thoughts
- Say: "Let me step back and clarify that point..."
- Refer to the image: "Looking at this image, you can see..."
- Bridge to next slide: "The next slide will show this more clearly..."
- Never apologize for complexity: "This is challenging anatomy - let's work through it together"
