When PICA arises, 41 of 42 arose as single trunk, only 1 as duplicate trunk. When PICA absent, contralateral PICA or ipsilateral AICA supplies area normally supplied by absent PICA through enlarged anastomotic channels. Duplicate PICAs (when present) termed rostral and caudal duplicate PICAs with territories similar to medial and lateral trunks of bifurcated single PICA. Rostral duplicate PICA may loop upward into cerebellopontine angle mimicking AICA.",

Lateral medullary segment extends from olive prominence to glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory (CN IX/X/XI) rootlets, often forming loops among these nerves. Tonsillomedullary segment begins where PICA passes posterior to CN IX/X/XI. These nerves are frequently stretched around PICA loops, particularly when vessel is tortuous or forms prominent caudal loop. Perforating branches supply brainstem entry zones of these nerves.

Far-lateral/extreme lateral approach: provides access to anterior and lateral medullary segments, vertebral artery-PICA junction, and foramen magnum region; may require C1 laminectomy for low-origin PICAs and condylar drilling for ventral access.
