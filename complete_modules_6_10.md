# Complete Implementation Guide: Modules 6-10

## Summary of Remaining Work

**Total Content to Add:**
- Module 6: AICA vs PICA Comparison (10 questions)
- Module 7: Quantitative Mastery (20 questions)
- Module 8: Surgical Applications (12 vignettes)
- Module 9: Comprehensive Assessment (33 questions)
- Module 10: Mastery Certification (8 questions)

**Total: 83 questions across 5 modules**

## Implementation Strategy

Due to the large volume of content (83 questions with detailed explanations), I recommend the following approach:

### Option 1: Complete Python Script (Recommended)
Create a Python script that:
1. Reads the current notebook
2. Generates all module content from JSON sources
3. Adds all cells programmatically
4. Saves the updated notebook

### Option 2: Manual Template-Based Addition
Use the established pattern from Modules 3-5 to manually add each module:
- Module header (markdown)
- Unlock check (code)
- Reading content (markdown)
- Free recall challenge (markdown)
- Assessment header (markdown)
- 10-33 question cells (code)
- Score submission widget (code)

### Option 3: Batch Cell Generation
Generate all cell content in a structured format, then add via repeated NotebookEdit calls.

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Modules 1-2: Pre-existing (22 questions)
- ✅ Modules 3-4: Recently added (22 questions)
- ✅ Module 5: Just completed (10 questions)
- **Total so far: 54 questions**

**In Progress:**
- ⏳ Module 6: Partial (reading added, need 10 questions + score widget)

**Remaining:**
- ❌ Module 7: Not started (20 questions)
- ❌ Module 8: Not started (12 vignettes)
- ❌ Module 9: Not started (33 questions)
- ❌ Module 10: Not started (8 questions)

## Recommendation

Given the scope and the need for accuracy (especially Module 7's quantitative verification requirement), I recommend:

1. **Complete Module 6 now** (10 questions + widgets)
2. **Create comprehensive script** for Modules 7-10
3. **Execute script** to add all remaining content
4. **Verify** all numerical values in Module 7
5. **Test** notebook functionality
6. **Update** tasks.md with completion status

This approach ensures:
- Consistency across all modules
- Proper verification of quantitative data
- Complete implementation in reasonable time
- Maintainable code structure

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
A) Continue adding Module 6 questions one-by-one (10 more cells)
B) Create complete automation script for all remaining modules
C) Generate all content in batch format for manual review

**My recommendation: Option B** - Create automation script for efficiency and accuracy.
